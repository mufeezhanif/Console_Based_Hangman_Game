# Hangman Console Game 🎮

This repository contains the code for a console-based Hangman game created as a part of our first-semester project.
## Overview 📋

Hangman is a word-guessing game where players try to guess the word, one letter at a time, while trying not to exceed a limited number of incorrect guesses. In our console-based version, there are three exciting modes for players to enjoy.

## Game Modes 🕹️

1. **Classic Mode**:  
   In this mode, a random word is selected from a chosen category and difficulty level. The player has 6 chances to guess the word. If they fail to guess it within these 6 mistakes, they lose the game.

2. **Time Trial Mode**:  
   The player has 60 seconds to guess as many words as possible. The goal is to get as many correct guesses within the time limit.

3. **Wordsmith Nemesis**:  
   A fast-paced mode where the player must guess words quickly to win the race. The challenge is all about speed and accuracy!

## Features ✨
- Multiple game modes: Classic, Time Trial, and Wordsmith Nemesis.
- Simple console-based UI.
- Word guessing logic.
- Limited number of wrong attempts before the game ends in Classic Mode.
- Timed challenge in Time Trial Mode.
